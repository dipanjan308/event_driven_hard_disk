# Event-driven algorithm for two dimensional hard disks
This code simulates system of hard circular disks using event driven method Molecular Dynamics. Hard particles do elastic collisions with each other and with the walls of the box. The theoretical detail of the algorithm is obtained from the 2nd chapter of the book [Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations](https://global.oup.com/ukhe/product/statistical-mechanics-algorithms-and-computations-9780198515364?cc=gb&lang=en&), by Werner Krauth.
